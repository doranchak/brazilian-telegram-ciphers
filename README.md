# brazilian-telegram-ciphers
Cryptanalysis of 19th century enciphered telegrams from Brazil.

These were sent to me by a student at Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil, researching telegrams exchanged between authorities in a period of State arbitration in Brazil.  He found encrypted documents in the process.  They were written in Portuguese in 1894.  

There are two ciphers.  [The first](https://github.com/doranchak/brazilian-telegram-ciphers/blob/main/ciphers/Cipher%201%20image.png) is a simple substitution cipher.  It resembles an [Atbash cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash) where A=Z, B=Y, C=X, etc.   [The second](https://github.com/doranchak/brazilian-telegram-ciphers/blob/main/ciphers/Cipher%202%20image.png) was found to be a simple columnar transposition.

The author of the second message evidently is asking for the postponement of the regional elections to the president of the republic due to the difficulties in the municipalities of the state.
